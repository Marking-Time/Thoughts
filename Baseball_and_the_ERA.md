# Baseball and the ERA

- Catch and Pitch
- Pitch and Catch  

It's a game we learned as children. It's the oldest game there is.  
As we grew we learned more, the fastballs, curves and sliders. We learned the ricochet, the "no look" and the slow roll. Whether we were the pitcher or the catcher we both learned one thing. We learned to trust our partner. We learned that the beauty of well executed play is its own reward.  

As we aged we learned hard lessons. We learned that the game can be cheated. That it can be commodified and abused. We were encouraged to put aside childish games. We were told to value the statistics, the wins and losses, more than the beauty. We learned that playing catch and pitch in a strong wind is hard.

*because no one has an NDA on me*  
These are hard times
- With the wildfires and the axmen butchers of the BBQ
- With the immigration to the gas door
- With more than half of the population enshrined as not quite smart enough to make their own decisions
- With dragons, transexuals and transhumans competing with the "have not" biologicals  

It's a long list.  
I think its time for the __Equal Rights Amendment__ to become law not simply because it solves problems, but because we love the game.
