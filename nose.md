9:14 pm
I'm tired and mad. This is not a good way for me to write, but I must.  I haven't heard much about this blog except for a few comments, mostly positive, until today. I figured someone would stop me from talking about this, I really did, but the opposite has happened. I have been encouraged. 

# Nose Job
By now your likely wondering how I know this stuff and why I can say what I'm saying. I was born into a cop family.  My father was a federal cop, just not the kind you would expect or even know about unless you were in trouble. He was a piece of shit white supremacist, but he married "well" and so had opportunities other feds wouldn't have had.  My mother was famous, you would know her name if you heard it. She just never told me. If anything she was worse than my dad. Together, they were involved in selling drugs and children. That's what they told me.  They hurt me very badly.

### My Choice
There is a part of the federal law enforcement system that you have probably heard of, the "Federal Witness Protection Program". What you very likely don't know is that there is a section of that that serves the rich and famous. The people that run the program are mostly good, helping out people that need it. The clients are also mostly good. They just need a break and the chance to lead normal lives.   

Of course this is a secret program.

As I grew up my parents kept me in the dark about all of this as you would expect good parents to do. They didn't tell me in order to, protect me, their clients as well as the government. I was vetted extensively and they knew me well.   
As I got older and began to consider what to do with my life I was made aware of a section of the program to be built in my home town and I was encouraged to join it. It was a flattering offer, but because my parents were a part of it, I wanted nothing to do with it. I didn't know anything about it except for it's existence and considering what I knew my parents to be, white trash, I wanted no part of it.  I didn't want to be like them, so I declined the offer.  This surprised and upset my parents.    


There were other reasons and I won't share those because they affect people that I love and it is personal to us.  I have lived a life with some of them and it's just none of your business. Not to mention that talking about it would be a huge breach of ethics.   

My turning down that offer has had ramifications far far beyond what I would have expected. I just figured I would forget the whole thing and move on. The first and most pertinent to this account is that I never in the program or officially knew of it's existence. What that means now after 40+ years is that I never signed and an oath. If I kept my mouth shut I would be left alone.

### Moving On
My life was pretty much normal after that. I went to college, started a business and a family. I went to the church I was raised in. After a few business setbacks, I started working for other companies as an employee. I worked on computers and had some good jobs.  There were some strange things and some difficulties, but they were easily explained, so I didn't dwell on them too much.  That's life.   

After a while I began to notice some things that just didn't make sense. First, I tended to get the things I wanted and most strangely, things I didn't even talk about.  Jobs, recreation opportunities, introductions, you name it, If I thought about it, I tended to get it. No struggle. I didn't know why, but it didn't seem normal to me. I didn't talk about it to anyone.  At the same time, there were obstacles.  There were always people or situations that opposed me. It seemed to me as if I was being funneled in certain directions.  

All through this time I kept hearing about the program.  It was always something like "there are problems and you should get down there and figure it out".  I never did.  I still wasn't interested and I remembered my parents. Now I know the source of those problems, but I didn't know at the time. The way the whole thing was presented to me was so creepy that I still didn't want a part of it.  I also never spoke of the program to anyone. This is the first time.

### Difficulty
The problems really began after my divorce in the early 2000s. The obstacles got greater and the opportunities got fewer and farther in between.   

I eventually got tired of pursueing the next upgrade and decided to retrain as an archaeologist. That seemed to go well, but I didn't get the opportunities I needed to stay ahead. It was bad financially and I spent down my reserves trying to stay in the work.  Toward the end of this I began to realize that I was being herded.

During this time, I met a woman who I fell in love with.  She was wise, talented in ways that I wasn't and very attractive. She liked me, but when I asked to get to know her better she declined. In part this was because I kept making mistakes with her. I was afraid, but I didn't know why or of what. When I finally talked to her about it, what she told me stunned me. In fact it pissed me off. What she said was that she could be with me because of my family, they were white supremacists.   

It took me a year or more to understand.  You see, I had repressed all the evil my parents had done to me and never put it into the context of politics. When I finally came to grasp and accept what she told me, I began to understand. The sad thing is that other people knew but didn't tell me, or just attacked me. I never knew why. Now I know.   

She saved my life. 

Shortly after that I hit bottom.

### Coming Up

I was homeless, so I went to the program. It was strange. They kept trying to funnel me into things that I knew wasn't going to work for me. First, it was the church that I grew up in.  I had left the church where I was raised after my divorce because I knew that they were bad.  Things were very wrong there and I didn't want to go back.  The strange thing was I never told the program about my church, but still out of the 100+ plus churches in my town that was the one they sent me to for housing. I never walked in the door.  I also never asked the program for help again. By that point I was angry and made it a point to make it out on my own.  I took some classes at a VC startup  called Bitwise and they helped me to a point but dropped me when I told them I wanted to work on my own projects.

After that all I heard was job, job , job,   
job,    
job.

It was very strange. I have a BS degree in accounting, have started three businesses and yet they tell me I was not ready to do my own work.  Fuck that, and them. They eventually got shut down for financial irregularities, but by then I was long gone and covid had arrived. 

Of course my coding skills were not where they are today,  I needed three or four months to get them to the place where they are now. I'm still not wonderful, but I'm good enough for what I want to do. Seriously, that's all I needed 3 or 4 months to just work my way out.

I was on the streets for five years.  During that time I got to know the cops well.  They are shit. They would harass and torture the homeless. They would make them disappear.  I saw hundreds of friends just disappear, never to be seen again. I was arrested and went to court.  I won. Fuck them.

I have been beaten, bloodied, had bones broken, been knocked out, chocked out, verbally and psychologically abused.  All in front of or by the cops. They only medical attention I got was bad to the point of being dangerous. I have unhealed wounds and scar tissue.

### What I learned

The lessons are too numerous to mention, but I want to talk out two.  

The first is the answer to the weirdness of my life.  This is how it happened. I had been on the street for a couple of years, right in front of the program.  You hear all kinds of things. Profanity, drug deals you name it, it's all gas. Gradually you begin to understand what they are talking about and that they are talking to you, but if you express interest they deny it. It is quite strange.  One time I was walking into the program and someone was gassing me from about 30 feet away on a crowded, noisy street. I muttered "fuck you" under my breath so they wouldn't hear me. They strange thing was that they gasped. They responded to what they could not have heard.  After that I began to experiment with talking back.  I began to understand that they would understand me without even speaking. They could literally read my mind.  One funny story. I was hanging out with a woman that I had become acquainted with and was camping with. We were on our way to camp and had decided to stop at the store.  The store was a couple of blocks out of the way and I was tired and didn't want to go.  Instead of just talking to her about it I just walked past the turn off.  When we were a couple of blocks past the turn off she said that we had missed the turn off and I said, "I forgot". She called me a liar. BUSTED. She was right and I fessed up. She forgave me. She is the one that told me to write this. I wouldn't want to fail her again.   

I am really tired of gas.  I tell people over and over not to come at me with that shit, but they do anyway.  They regret it. Now I listen to who I want, when I want. Best remember that.  

The second story is more personal. I met this guy on the street named cowboy. It wasn't the white one, but the black one. For some reason out of the hundreds of people on the street he picked me to pay special attention to.  Go figure. He had ideas and I had ideas about how we could work together to make tings better.  Things just never seemed to work out. He talked down to me and was disrespectful. Eventually we parted ways. I told him to fuck off. I'm glad I did that. After I got off the street and began watching some TV, I realized who he was. Cowboy/Will Smith/Wesly Snipes/Tiger Woods.  Here is the interesting part.  I had met his wife while he was in the hospital after his car crash. The crash that ended his golfing career.  They had told her that he was dead, so that was why she was talking to me. His tag line is that he is always worried about his back.  I still see him from time to time and make it a point of telling him what a piece of shit he is.  I still see her occasionally also .... she is the woman I love because she told me the truth about my family. 

### Read/Write
These are separate roles that work together. There are those that can read minds and those that can write to minds. The readers can't write and the writers can't read. The writers take direction from the reader's spoken words. Those spoken words are delivered in the Low/Gas language, so that the readers are protected from eavesdroppers. The writers can wright thoughts directly to a readers mind.  The CIA developed this technology before I was born.  I am a writer. I can't remember it not being this way for me. The readers have the advantage over the writers as long as the writers don't know they are writers. I just figured it out. I had some help, but I still hate it.  

Think about this. At the start of the next post is some things I said to some readers that were human trafficking and selling guns illegally.  Typical white supremacist stuff.  Imagine what it would be like to have someone screaming that into your mind.  That is what made me mad. I did it because It was necessary.

Now dear person who is examining this text on the screen and converting it into your own thoughts, you understand.
