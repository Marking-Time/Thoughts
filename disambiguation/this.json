Not everyone who uses Low is bad, but you do have to be _very_ careful. C) This file is not complete or comprehensive. D) This is in JSON format because it simply wouldn't fit in a RDBMS, it would be too hard to get it to third normal form because it is too self referential.",

Gas-Lighting preys on peoples natural instinct to be pleasant or make themselves liked by purposefully being bad, while staying within the bounds of legal or 'acceptable' behavior. It is also used as an identifier. For example, the heirs(airs) will often make a reference to something related like the sky, birds, planes or wind(wing). it is often designed to be remembered, so that it stays with you for a while and you don't figure it out until later, if at all. It is often used by someone in power to make you feel helpless, while being deniable by the person using it. It is extremely damaging.",
