### The Language of the Low  

This is dificult for me to write.  It's hard because this information cuts deep, but if you've read some of my other thoughts you know that I am not concerned about myself.  

What bothers me is __how it affects the innocent__.  

The Low language is the language of the disenfranchised.  The language of slaves.  The language of people with something to hide or poeple to protect. It is __patois__. It can sound like giberish, but can also be used in grammer that is completely correct.  It depends on the words used and the context in which they are used. I don't consider myself to be an expert in the language, but I can hold my own.  

The reason I'm writing about Low now is that it has been compromised.  It has been taken up by those that wish to enslave us. They use it to mock us.
