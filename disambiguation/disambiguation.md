### The Language of the Low  

This is dificult for me to write.  It's hard because this information cuts deep, but if you've read some of my other thoughts you know that I am not concerned about myself.  

What bothers me is __how it affects the innocent__.  

The Low language is the language of the disenfranchised.  The language of slaves.  The language of people with something to hide or poeple to protect. It is __patois__. It can sound like giberish, but can also be used in grammer that is completely correct.  It depends on the words used and the context in which they are used. I don't consider myself to be an expert in the language, but I can hold my own.  

The reason I'm writing about Low now is that it has been compromised.  It has been taken up by those that wish to enslave us. They use it to mock us. 

### Some  Characteristics of Low 
- It is a language of phonemes
    + Low is promarily a spoken language although some words can be written
    + It is often mumbled or slurred when spoken to disguise the message - remember where it came from
- Synonyms - Means the same but spelled differently
    + An personal example: I work in Mexico because I speak Mexican(hexican).  I write code that contains numbers expressed in the hexadecimal number system common to programmers. If I said I was going to Mexico that could be translated in low to mean that "I'm going to write some code".
- Antonyms - The rule of opposites. If I said I was going north, the Low translation is that I'm going south.
    + Personal example: If I was talking to a woman I was attracted to and I KNEW she spoke Low. I might say "Your the ugliest thing I've even seen!" Don't try that one at home.
    + An example you might have heard - I'm trying to help you. 
- Homonyms - Sounds/spelled the same but has a differnt meaning.
    + Example - "You're so mean". > You're so average.
- Characteristics - Referring to something by its characteristics  
    + Real Example: Birds have wings, beaks, feathers, eggs
- Associations - What is associated with the thing being referenced
    + Real Example: Birds are associated with air, wind
- Languages - Other languages can be used to express an idea or word
    + A complex example using Spanish: He is from Guatamala
        - Opposite - He is she
        - Guata mala - Guata - sounds like whata
        - Guatamala - In Spanish mal means bad 
        - Translation - She is a very bad.
- Behaviors - How something acts can be a way to identify it. The meaning depends on the sender and the context.
    + It can be a way of saying Hi
    + It can be mocking
    + Behaviors of birds: They fly, they peck on the ground and stick thier buts in the air, They fly away when startled (they are cowards)
- Context - What makes Low so powerful is that it can masquerade as normal speech. This means all of the examples above can be taken in more than one way. They can be (but are not always) double entendres.
- It is Extensible - It can be added to or can change over time and by context.

Be __very careful__ with the above information.  It can get people hurt. You can get yourself hurt.
