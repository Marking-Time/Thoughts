# World War Two - An Alternate Battle Plan - Europe
__Or how the movie would have been made by Hollywood__

### I Guess We Are Lucky The Fascists Were Stupid   
__Secret Weapons__   
If Hollywood would have written the script for WW2, they would have made sure the Germans had some secret weapons up their sleeves that we didn't see coming. Here is one.   
__TorSpeedo__   
The TorSpeedo is a land launched torpedo with a range of approximately 15 miles. Both the allies and the axis powers had submarine launched torpedo with that range, so why didn't the Germans build a land based system to cover the English Channel?  It would have had the effect of keeping British at arms length and and aiding the blockade of England.   

Also, it would have been a major hindrance to any invasion. They could have been launched in volleys that would have effectively limited travel in the English Chanel. Of course the allies would have responded with their own system, but the addition of such a system would have had a major impact on how the war was conducted.
