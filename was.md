### History
We have a complicated history. Much of it is known like slavery and the civil war. Some of it is not commonly known like how close California was to becoming a slave state before the civil war. You can't say it was suppressed because the books are there, but it is not talked about. The history of the Mexican miners during the gold rush and the theft of Native American land is ignored. It's not quite censorship, you can still publish what you want, but if it isn't part of "what we all know" it becomes political fodder, just an opinion. Some of the wrongs have been addressed while others have been left to fester, leaving scar tissue that not only never heals but becomes multi-generational.  

Other things have been completely censored. Public libraries routinely ban books for ideologies and lifestyles that are completely commonplace.  In some places, it is impossible to find books with gay characters in them or speak openly about the actual working conditions of factory workers.  Of course they are available on Amazon.  

### Present Day
It sometimes happens that a public figure gets into trouble by doing stupid or evil things. The remedy is to ban them. This is a big problem in Hollywood. It boils down to how people are paid.  The name doesn't matter for their likeness.  It is well known that the names of the actors that you seen on the TV screen, internet or at the movies are not their real names. Those names and characters are owned by the makers of the production. The actors real names are hidden for "privacy" reasons.   
It is supposed to be this way so the actors can have lives without the complications of stardom, but it is also a method to rehabilitate actors that are literally bad. It's not uncommon for a gronken piece of shit to appear in a "old" movie that has been miraculously and meticulously "restored" because the original negatives were lost or damaged. It would be like knowing Matt Dillon got a nose job but didn't tell anyone until 50 years later, or like John Boy lost 50 years of age to star in a modern war movie.  All of those things are __easy__ to do with today's technology.  It's just a copy and paste.

Wouldn't it be funny to see Gene Hackman star in a movie about your next door neighbor's gardener? It'll be filmed next week.

### Nothing New
Surveillance and censorship are not new in this country. Remember the old movies that featured an unscrupulous character who steamed open letters, read the contents and then ironed them closed again before delivering them to the hapless victim? Or the nosy operator who listened in a the conversations of people who were getting some love on the sly. It was a good laugh back in the day. Of course it never happened, there are federal laws against it and who would risk that? Post Master "General" Pigseth himself would be so far up their asses that they would spend the rest of their lives in gitmo. So why was it a laugh in the movies?

I wonder if they can mass scan letters to read the folded contents of a sealed envelope? They can do it with ancient scrolls, but it would likely be too expensive to do that with typed text today. Just don't send your private letters with tinfoil hats. That would just be crazy.
