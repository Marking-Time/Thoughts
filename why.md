I spent almost two months hiking in the Sierra Nevada range last summer.  It had been more than a decade since I had spent much time in the Sierra and I knew that at 64 I needed to reacquire those skills or they would be lost to me forever.  
It was great to be back in nature. After a while I began to notice the changes that had occurred in my absence.  I was in three parts of the range, Yosemite, Shasta and Donner Pass, so I know that my observations were not localized events, but part of a larger problem.   

I began in July and I hoped that I had missed the mosquito window that occurs every spring.  Sure enough there were no mosquitos and I was too happy about that to think about it at the time.  I did see some megafauna, but it was strange. I saw some deer once but they were behind high fences.  Those were the only deer I saw all summer.  I also saw bears in a couple of locations but they were the domesticated variety kept around to amuse and scare the tourists. There was one funny episode where the campground I was staying at made a BIG deal over keeping my food in a the bear locker while the town 1/4 a mile away had plastic trash cans.  It irritated me at the time, but in retrospect they may have been telling me something. I did see the dumb smurf bear, so I can check that off my life list.  I slept in bear country without keeping my food in a canister and had no problems. 

I did worry about squirrels getting at my food, but I stayed pretty close to camp most times, so that wasn't a problem. In fact I didn't see many squirrels or chipmunks at all. The thing that bothered me most was that my water filter kept clogging up with algae. Water filters are necessary to prevent getting the runs from  the giardia in the streams and lakes.  Why weren't the fish and frogs eating up the algae? I noticed some Native Americans complaining about the poor fishing, so maybe the fish and frogs were all gone. I guess we can add those species to the buffalo and beaver that we killed off to force the Natives onto the reservations. That made me sad.

## It is a Lie

I love nature and have since I was a child. Sleeping in the rough has been part of my life for a long time. The destruction of the natural ecosystems horrified me but it is the other lies that we are being told that that anger me. I have listed some of them below:
  
### Law Enforcement
Over twenty years ago we had the technology to read a license plate from space.  Fifteen years ago there was a company that was selling a camera that could be mounted on an airplane that had enough resolution to identify a person from 30,000 feet.  That is high enough to be invisible to the average city dweller. We now have drones and have the ability to monitor everything. These drones were complained about last summer in the North Eastern US. Nobody knew what they were and our politicians didn't tell us. These drones are a part of the Starlink network and can be identified by the grid like pattern that they fly as well as the lights that are different than those required by the FAA. They are flying all over the country. I really don't have anything to hide, but I do prefer my privacy. It is guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.
- They hide this surveillance by telling us that they get the information from door cameras. What a joke. 
- Street crime is a thing of the past. If you can monitor an entire city with a small drone and can track a person to and from a crime, why persist with the idea that the streets are dangerous? Given all of that, visible law enforcement is simply a show of force designed to intimidate. If you are a victim of a crime you now know who did it. The cops.
- Ever notice how you never live next to a cop? They don't even live on the same street as us. Why is that? Doesn't it make sense that the way to build trust with law enforcement is to have them live amongst us? Wouldn't it be nice to know that the cop down the street had your back? The truth is that they hide their identity from us because they are embarrassed at the jobs they perform. They tell their children that they are "teachers" so they won't be harassed. Fucking cowards.
- They aren't all bad, but the system in its totality is. Many of them are boiled frogs. It crept upon them slowly and now they can't get out of the pot. In fact, they would be disappeared if they tried. 

### Drugs
Given pervasive surveillance, how are we supposed to believe that that there is a drug "problem" in the US. They had drug sniffing dogs 50 years ago, but now they have drug sniffing phones.  I think it was because the dogs went on strike.  

Drugs are used as a method of social control.  After all, what better way to control a population than to get them addicted to a substance and then make it illegal? Complicit in this lie are law enforcement, the health care system, the courts and the "program" system that profits from the whole thing while claiming to "help".

### The Snooze
I mean "The News". Of course there are others that know that all of the above happens.  They are easily controlled by their fame or co-opted by the allure of power. Most of the news is twisted beyond recognition, but if you know the system it can be figured out. It's just not worth the trouble.  

Included in all of this is the internet and social media.  The enshitification is obvious. A little too obvious. It doesn't make sense to destroy your product with terrible AI generated content that drowns out what used to be a reliable medium. 

### Why This Is Happening 
It is social control. They are hiding something from us.
