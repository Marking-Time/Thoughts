# Thoughts
This is a repo to contain ideas. I chose to use this instead of gists because I wanted to edit and store this on my computer rather than having it stuck on GitHub. It also gives me the ability to add a license.  Each thought will be in its own .md file listed below.

__Why This__
<p>I have a broad range of experience, training and interests. One of the problems this creates is that often I don't have the ability to produce what I know is achievable. That coupled with my ever increasing age makes me realize that I will never be able to do or produce all the ideas that I can dream up.</p>

__A Short Skills List:__ 
- Education
    + Bachelors degree (BS) in Business with the accounting option from California University Fresno (1995)
    + A concentration in Anthropology/Archaeology Fresno City College (2010)
- Careers in which I have  at least 10 years experience
    + Landscaping - Including construction and maintenance
    + IT - Including desktop and server hardware and software. This includes operating systems as well as desktop applications like MS products and server applications like email systems. I have designed built and maintained LANs and Wi-Fi networks. I have created users and assigned permissions to network resources. I have have experience in security including hard drive forensics and preparing evidence for presentation in court (chain of custody). I also have experience in software development as a full stack web developer and can use HTML/CSS JavaScript and Python as well as SQL databases.
    + Archaeology - I have surveyed/recorded, excavated and monitored sites across two US regions (California and Great Basin)
- Interests and Hobbies
    + Hiking - I have hiked/backpacked hundreds of miles and spent months in the Sierras and other ranges. This includes both summer and winter experience.
    + Tinkering/Handyman - I am comfortable using shop equipment and can build/maintain a variety of household systems.
    + Art - Often how something looks or how it makes you feel is as important as how it functions.
