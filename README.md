# Thoughts
This is a repo to contain ideas. I chose to use this instead of gists because I wanted to edit and store this on my computer rather than having it stuck on github. It also gives me the ability to add a license.  Each thought will be in its own .md file listed below.

__Why This__
<p>I have a broad range of experience, training and interests. One of the problems this creates is that often I don't have the ability to produce what I know is achievable. That coupled with my ever increasing age makes me realize that I will never be able to do or produce all the ideas that I can dream up.</p>

- Education
    + Bachelors degree (BS) in Business with the accounting option from California Unversity Fresno (1995)
