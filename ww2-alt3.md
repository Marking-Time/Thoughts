__Or how the movie would have been made by Hollywood__

### Prologue   
Japan had long desired to be included in the club of modern industrial nations. By the late 1930s they had adopted modern industrial manufacturing techniques and had a significant industrial capacity. In the Japanese worldview that also meant having colonies like European countries and the United States.  

To prepare to achieve these desires the Japanese invested heavily in military technology. Since Japan is an island nation, this included a modern Navy including both battleships and aircraft carriers. The also built very capable aircraft that rivaled some of the best in the world.

### Pre-War Years   
World War Two is commonly thought to have begun when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939, but this ignores Japanese actions. The Japanese invaded China in July 1937 and by December had taken Nanking, a city that had a large western component.   

This action in China angered the Europeans and the United States, but given the predominant sentiment of isolationism  in the US no military action was taken.  The US and Europe did initiate economic sanctions against Japan including access to the banking system.  This prevented Japan from buying oil on the world market.  

Anticipating a significant US response, the Japanese planned, but finally decided against the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This left the US fleet at Pearl Harbor intact. The Japanese plan a different approach to attain their needs of oil and the creation of a security perimeter. This delayed the US entry into WW2.  

### Order of Battle   
__1939-1940__   
- The Japanese begin their battle by moving into Vietnam and down the peninsula into Malaysia.  Then they continue by overtaking Indonesia across the strait of Malacca. This gave them access to to the Indian Ocean. The acquisition of these countries allow the Japanese to access middle eastern oil once the Germans complete their acquisition of the middle eastern oil reserves.     

__1941-1942__   
-  The Japanese take Borneo from their Malaysian holdings on the Island.
-   The Japanese turn west and take the Philippines, a US territory. This action finally motivates the US government to declare war on the Axis countries.   
-  The Japanese secure their newly acquired countries with garrison troops and torspeedo technology. These actions make the already difficult task of an amphibious invasion much more difficult.  
- Given the fortifications of the acquired islands, and the ability of the Japanese forces to resupply, Us naval operations were much less effective.  

__1943-1945__   
-  The Japanese take the Solomon Islands and launch and invasion of New Guinea. The invasion of New Guinea is the most difficult fight of the war for the Japanese. Backed up by Australian and US forces the country is finally taken in late 1944.  Given the extensive fortifications of their island acquisitions the Japanese are able to hold most most of their territory till the end of the war.  
-  By mid 1944 the Japanese learn of the US development of nuclear weapons.  By this time the Germans were making progress on their own version of the technology and it was becoming clear that while nuclear technology would make an effective weapon it was also clear that it rendered the land where it was used useless.  

### End of War   
By this time both the Germans and the Japanese had attained their military goals and were willing to enter peace talks with the Allied forces.  Given the prospect of very difficult military operations to defeat the Axis powers a war weary America agreed to a peace deal.
