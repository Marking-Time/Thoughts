# International Index  
Much is made these days about the state of the internet. The technical types call it "enshitification" and it refers to the increasingly useless search as well as the pervasive ads and tracking.  It has the following components:
- Search that displays what the search engine owner wants, not necessarily what the user is looking for.  The data is there and if you know the url it can be found, but if the user doesn't know the url the user is forced to search.
- This has allowed the search engines to funnel traffic to sites that pay them for ranking, or to sites that scrape the users data.
- This has become what the anthropologists  call a "control mechanism".  People can be controlled by the information that is available to them and if a user can't get good/unbiased information then they cannot make good decisions.

### No Standards
In the days before the internet, approximately the year 2000, It was fairly easy to find something without being force fed useless information.  A user looked in the "Phone Book" which was a physical book, available for free, that contained both ads that were indexed by subject and an alphabetical index of listings. Between the index and the ads it was fairly easy to find what you were looking for. The phone book was published by the phone company. Because the phone company was a monopoly it was regulated by the government to make it fair for everyone.

### Search Monopoly  
The search engines have become a monopoly that need to be regulated. They are using their power to control business and influence politics.  These companies have traditionally used the argument that government should not regulate them because that would harm innovation.  

The problem with the tech companies argument is that there is not much left to innovate in the public internet space. To increase profits to meet shareholder demands they must create new revenue streams by selling user data. 

### Proposal 
What the internet needs is an index similar to the old Phone Book. Technically it would work something like this:

```
-- entity
    |-- *webiste/URL
    |-- *contact
    |-- *geo-location
    |-- *meta
```
Where:
- An entity is a person or business
- An entity can be created by anyone at not cost to them
- None of the options(*) are mandatory, but there must be at least one.
- geo-location can be specific to a physical address or broad to a city/state/country.  
- meta 
	+ contains up to 5 Kb of data - approximately 1000 words - that can be a description or keywords
	+ can not stand alone and can only be present with another option
- The search providers must index this data without appending to it, or the browser can search the index for the user. Also, the user can generate their own search method.

### Solution
The proposal would eliminate the power of the monopolies to control the user's data. It would be inexpensive for the search providers to implement and it wouldn't interfere with their existing business.
