I generally don't stray into the political. I have reasons for that, many of them personal. I have people that I love and wish to protect and talking about what I know to be true could hurt them. Also, commenting on something that I have no control over, have chosen not to participate in and feel powerless to affect makes me seem whiny - not a good look for me. Finally, this is primarily a tech blog and politics is beyond its scope. I speak now because I can't keep what I know to be true secret. I have to be able to say, at least to myself, that I did what I could.   

Oddly enough, I do have the qualifications to speak here. I have experience, education and training in anthropology and business as well as a long history with law enforcement.  I have the unique perspective of being an outsider with inside knowledge combined with the ability to analyze and communicate what I know to be true.  

# Agreements 

Life is an interesting thing. It is overly complex. It doesn't seem to make sense. It has one objective - survival. There is, however,  a secret sauce hidden in plain site that makes it powerful.  

### Sexual Reproduction  
In biology we learn that there are two types of reproduction, asexual and sexual.  They are the method for which all life is replicated. They differ in one major way.  Asexual reproduction duplicates life exactly.  One fungi is the same as the next. Sexual reproduction is different.  It combines two different genomes and merges them together.  It doesn't happen in the way you would think.  You would think the formula would be A+B=C where A is one genome, B is the other and C is the logical combination of the two. It isn't that way. The result of sexual reproduction is not the simple addition of A and B.  The formula is A+B+X=C. A and B remain the same, but there is a third factor (x) baked into the formula. This X factor is a bit of randomness that comes in during the cell division process. It adds genetic variation to life that is formed sexually. This variation is the source of evolution and is the secret sauce that enables life to survive change.  There is almost always some life that is just different enough to survive. A genetic combination that is at a disadvantaged before a change can be advantaged by change.

### Complications 
All of the diversity resulting from sexual reproduction does pose challenges to complex life and cultures. It is difficult to create an advanced social structure when we are all literally different in ways that we don't even know about or understand.  The solution is agreements.  We agree to do things in certain ways.  We agree to discuss issues that concern us.  We agree on principles of behavior and governance. It could be argued that agreements are the factor that enable culture.  How could it be possible to create technology that is more complex than could be produced by a band level culture without them?

The agreement is a combination of consensus on a particular thing, the modification of behavior to conform to the agreement and the enforcement of the agreement when the agreeing parties do not comply with the agreement.  Each of those three things are necessary for agreements to work.  

### Agreements

The hard part of agreements is trust.  The ability to trust all of the parties forming an agreement is critical to the successful creation and implementation of an agreement. This is the hard thing to say.  Trust has been broken.
