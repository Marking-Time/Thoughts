# Stable Scooter
A method for stablizing two wheeled scooters at slow speeds
### Need
I have noticed that scooters are hard to control at slow speeds making them dificult for older users to operate.  A stabilization method added to both standing and seated two wheeled scooters would add the safety necessary for seniors to operate them efectively as well as create aditional use cases.
### Idea
Add a flywheel and a gyroscopic stabilizer monitored by a arduino/Rasberry Pi to create the mechanism. This is similar to to the mechanism in the Segway, but it acts in the horizontal plane rather than forward/backward. The operator should be able to step on/off the scooter without worrying about tipping the thing over.
### Uses
This mechanism gives the abilty to operate at slow speeds making the scooter safer at intersections or in tight spaces. This could also be used by and electric seated scooter to give the user the abilty to take the operator into a store to do shopping without the size of a three or four wheeled mobility device. It could also be used on sidewalks and streets.
