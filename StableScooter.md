# Stable Scooter
A method for stablizing two wheeled scooters at slow speeds
### Need
I have noticed that scooters are hard to control at slow speeds making them dificult for older users to operate.  A stabilization method added to both standing and seated scooters would add the safety necessary for seniors to operate them efectively as well as create aditional use cases for other uses.
### Idea
Add a flywheel and a gyroscopic stabilizer monitored by a arduino/Rasberry Pi to create the mechanism. This is similar to to the mechanism in the Segway, but it acts in the horizontal plane rather than forward/backward.
