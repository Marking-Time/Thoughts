This is the last one for tonight. 

# Believe It Or Not  
All of what I have talked about in Part 2 is legal and this is how it works and how I think it came to be.  

### How It Happened
This technology was developed in stages with the read/write part coming first. It was developed by the CIA during their ESP and mind control experiments. It was hard to control and if administered to an adult probably dove most people insane.  I know I feel that way sometimes. I don't know how the technology physically works, but I do know from lived experience that it does work and that is what I described here.   

The trans-human part was developed more recently. I think in the last ten years. Put together, they are devastating. I think it was developed by private parties with testing done through the homeless and drug programs.  They tested on live subjects and killed the failures.  This is not what I know, but believe through observation.

### Legality
It should be fairly obvious that this technology is contentious and debated within the communities involved. Some want to use it for their own personal advantage.  Others oppose that. It is political.

The first part, was hidden by the CIA in as covert research and  made legal through the FISA(Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978) courts. The courts are separate from the regular judicial system and are secret with no obligation to report their rulings to anyone, including the Supreme Court  The judges of these courts are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme court, but do not report to the Supreme Court. The act separately. These courts are used to justify wiretapping of citizens who may have had contact with foreign nationals that want to harm the US. Over the years these courts have had their scope expanded to cover all surveillance of US citizens.   

The courts have the aspect of being ex parte, meaning they are one sided.  Their is prosecution or defense.  There is simply the Justice department asking for a particular thing to be done.  The person being examined by these courts is not notified. There is not obligation to publish findings.   

The effect this has is to create a separate power structure within the Federal government that is both unknown and unaccountable to anyone.  

I'm not a lawyer and what I know I got from Wikipedia. This seems wrong to me.
