# Climate Change?  

Is it real?

I thought I had it all figured out. I really did.  
But then I had __this thought.__  

## Growing Up
I grew up in California's San Joaquin valley (also called the central valley by the white trash that want to make the brown go away).  Born in 1960, I've seen much change.  One of the things that has changed is the climate. It used to be that the summers were hot, usually topping out between 92 and 97 degrees fahrenheit.  It did occasionally get to 100-102, but that was rare, maybe two or three times a summer.  
The winters were fairly mild with temperatures mostly staying above freezing. It was foggy though and that is what made me think. It wasn't uncommon to have 30 days in a row where we never saw the sun.  It could get depressing.  The fog would frequently roll in by 8pm and by 10pm it was often thick with visibility dropping to less than 50 feet. Driving was almost impossible and we would sometimes drive down the road with the driver door open so we could lean out and see the center line of the road. It was better than ending up in a ditch. The fog was a weird thing.  It felt like a blanket.  It would do strange things with sound. You could hear the sound, but you couldn't tell where it came from. Because of this, people developed their own signaling mechanisms. For example If you approached a group of people on the street on a foggy night, you would make some kind of sound or shuffle your feet so that they could hear you coming and wouldn't be surprised and think you were sneaking up on them.  I still have that habit.

The military loved the fog because you could hide so many things. Satellites didn't exist then, and the fog would cover everything like it was London. That's probably one of the reasons Fresno had a big military base during WW2. 

When I left last year the summer was the new typical norm of at least 30 days in a row with temperatures well over 100 and sometimes topping 110. Very hot. But the interesting thing was that the fog was gone. When I left, I hadn't seen a foggy night in two or three years. Not even one. Even as annoying as it was I missed it.

__Fog is caused by two things:__  
+ The temperature differential between night and day is the first and it hadn't changed.
+ The second requirement is that there must be moisture in the ground, but the amount of rainfall hadn't changed. We still got between 10 and 12 inches of rain a year.  

This confused me until I considered the Central Valley Project(CVP).  The CVP is a dam and canal project designed to first control flooding and secondly to provide irrigation water for the farmers. The project is a series of dams that capture the runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountains and store it for later use or release. The water is transferred throughout the valley by an extensive network of canals. The last of the project was completed in the 1970s.

Before the CVP the San Joaquin Valley had two major lakes. The first was Tulare Lake(sounds like TooLarry) located west of Tulare and the second was Buena Vista Lake west of Bakersfield.  The run off from the Sierra snow melt would first fill up Tulare lake and then flow south to fill up Buena Vista lake. Once Buena Vista filled up the water would flow north again until it reached the San Francisco bay and the Pacific. Each of these lakes could be as large as 20 miles across. Between the lakes and the surrounding marshes the land was inundated with water every year. That's where the water for the fog came from. It kept the ground saturated and filled up the aquifers.

That's what happened to the fog.  After the completion of the CVP it took 50 years for the land to dry up. And when the land dried up there was no more moisture in it for the creation of fog. There have been many consequences of the CVP from the destruction of Native American villages that used to line the lakes to the draining of the aquifers that are the source of drinking water for many of the cities.  It's the fog that I miss the most.  There was something special about it and it's what made my small town unique.  I don't care about the west side farmers, I want the fog back.

## What about Climate Change?  

This is where I got confused.  I did notice that things had gotten hotter in "The Valley" and for a very long time I figured that climate change was to blame.  I realize now that the heating in the valley had more to do with the lack of water that used to provide a cooling effect during the summer as well as provide the necessary moisture for the creation of fog in the winter. I now know that I just can't tell if climate change is real or not.  I guess I'll just have to trust the science.

The annoying thing is that we were told of the many other side effects of the CVP, but we weren't told about the fog.  I didn't even think about it until the 2010s when I stared to notice that the fog was gone. In retrospect it is obvious, so why not tell us?
