# Snooze Button  

These are strange times. Some of it is obvious, anyone can see it on the news.  It's the things I don't see that really concern me. A couple of examples.
-  I'm a developer, mostly small static sites, but none the less I am always looking for ways to make more money.  It seemed obvious to me that I build web sites in other languages and I hear Spanish all the time in my neighborhood, so it seemed obvious to me that I could build websites in English and Spanish.  From a technical perspective it would be easy, all you need is to copy the work already done for one language recreate it for the second language and translate the text. Copy - Paste - Simple.
    + As I was thinking about this idea, I realized that I don't see this in the web. WTF! Is everyone stupid? Building websites in Spanish is an obvious marketing opportunity. Or maybe not.
    + I then hopped on my VPN (Virtual Netscape Navigator) and went looking around. I found sites in Mexico for local businesses and they were in Spanish.  I also found sites that were bilingual with English as the landing page and Spanish as a clear option. So, why couldn't I see them when I use my regular browser?
    + I even saw a Spanish site where people were singing:  
    "For He's a Jolly  Good Felon"  
    "For He's a Jolly  Good Felon"    
    "For He's a Jolly  Good Felon"  
    "That Nobody can Deny!"  

    + In perfect English.
- I live near an airport. It can be a bit noisy, but that is made up for by the fun of seeing those huge planes land. I understand the physics, but it still seems like magic to me. On most days I see at least 10 planes a day landing or taking off (depending on wind conditions).  A few days ago I noticed that I hadn't seen a plane in a while, so I started to pay attention to that. Here is what I noticed.
    + I did not see any planes take off or land for three days.
    + I did see some small aircraft in the vicinity, but no commercial aircraft.
    + Why is that?

One of the tings you do when you are going to war or are at war is censor the media.  It makes sense for a number of reasons.  It keeps the people at home feel safe and productive. It keeps people from questioning authority.   

Also, air traffic is grounded to protect it. It really doesn't look good having a bunch of civilians killed in an "accident". People will ask questions.

### Is We or Is We Aint  
At war.  

I did see Pete Hegseth drunk at ~0945 PST on Friday January 30, 2025.  Fortunately he was in fast company so he was safe when he stumbled and fell on a bag of potato chips.  I sure am glad any potential enemies would never attack 8-5 M-F.
