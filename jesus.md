# Fake Jesus  
Of course I grew up Christian, and I have many fond memories of my friends there.   People like the twins Peggy and Pam, Kathy and Debbie and of course little Richard who we called that because he was so Little in stature and intellect (kids can be cruel - even Christian kids). It's a shame that he grew up to be quite the opposite.  He is now as big as a potato with eyes all over the place like genital warts. He just ate too much Candy, but truthfully that is just a Minor problem.

## True Believer   
I did believe with all my heart and was baptized into the Church. I did my best to live a christian life, but as I aged my view began to change.  I chaffed at the blatant falsehoods and mythology, but I stayed on the Church because that was where my friends and community were. I taught Bible school; I encouraged others to live a christian life.  

### It was Strict  
My religious tradition was strict to the point of silliness. For example there was the prohibition of dancing because that might lead to arousal.  This even applied to married folks because sex was for procreation only, no pleasure was allowed.  

There was also the 6000 year old earth, and the belief that only my church was going to heaven.  I began to think that it was only a church Fred Flintstone could love. It was segregated, but there were separate congregations for people that didn't look like us. Now I wonder if there were infiltrators who used makeup to pass.  There was also the lack of a provision in the Holy Scriptures for a separate heaven for other races (even though race is a cultural construct used as a control mechanism). Of course we all get to share hell.  

The concept of heaven and hell became a little problematic as well. If you didn't do what the preacher (who had the ability to know God's will, and could not be disagreed with) told you to do then you could wind up in hell tomorrow. The funny thing was even in that 2000 year old tradition that was constant and unchanging, it changed.  It reminded me of the Popeye cartoon when Wimpy would beg for a hamburger today and pay for it tomorrow.   

### The Biggest Problem   
The biggest issue I had with the my tradition was the apparent obliviousness by God to the suffering of his people.  Why does God allow the suffering of his people? Why does God allow war, hunger,  oppression, homelessness, bad government and the entitled cart pushing trolls that live under our freeway bridges? The "just do what I tell you to do" and I'll pay you off in heaven tomorrow became too much for me to take, so I left.  

### Community   
Naturally it wasn't all bad. The sense of community and belonging is hard to replace and consequently I don't criticize people who believe.  If you can find the ability to ignore the inconsistencies of religious tradition, then the rewards of fellowship can be worth it. I truly believe that this multi generational community is necessary for all of us.

## Modern Day Miracle Grow Network  
These days I take a more scientific approach. Even though my scientific education, training and experience is in the soft science of anthropology, I don't blame God for my inability to do complex math.  I am grateful for modern technology.   

I am truly astounded by some of the tech I see on TV.  There are many advances, but the ability to manipulate fire is truly remarkable. For example the Tesla cyber truck that burned to the ground in Las Vegas, but still had intact rubber tires just blew my mind. Also, the burning Wemouth cars seen last Sunday during the LA Riots brought me tears of joy.  I feel so fortunate to live in a country where OHSA has mandated flashing emergency lights that keep working even when the the car has practically burned to the ground. That was miraculous. I guess that the old poster of the "Cowboy according to OSHA" was a good thing after all. Best of all, it wasn't fake news, but applied science. 

## On the Other Hand   
Maybe I should just take a nap.  After all, sleeping is one of my core skills.
