# Domains and AI  
The following go together in the sense that they both put the responsibility and control with the user.  

### The Problem
Computers are getting more unreliable.  Quite frankly there are a number of problems. I could explain and solve many (but not all) of them, but that is beyond the scope of a blog post. Never the less here are a few:
- Finding things: Search used to be the way to find something on the internet, but that is not nearly as useful as it was in the past. Too often what you want to find is buried under a few pages of search results and useless, if not completely misleading, AI generated responses from the search provider. 
- Security: Security is a Joke. It never was easy, but today it is nearly impossible and we don't get the help we need from:
	- Browser makers
	- Operating system providers
	- Network providers
	- The government

There are many more problems, but that's a start.
### Solution - User Control
We, as users, are responsible both civilly and criminally for both the contents of the machines we operate and the operation itself. The issue is we don't have the tools to actually be responsible.  

#### Blocking
We need to be able to block things from getting onto our computers.  We need to be able to block websites by domain name and by code by pattern.  It should be a straight forward block list easily accessible in the browser and operating system. The existing tools are either too hard to implement (like on the OS level), or require us to trust some third party that you have to pay for the privilege of providing "protection" while they spy on us and steal our data.  

Why must we rely on AI self regulate? Isn't it obvious that they are incapable of being trusted. Why can't we block results that block content that we don't agree with, not something managed by a committee of "moderators" at a business that wants to maximize profits. An example of what I would like:
-  Why not train a LLM on the teachings of your religion and have the ability to implement it just for yourself?

It's not that hard.  It really isn't. We as users just need the will to demand it of the people that provide us computing hardware, software, networking and our government.
