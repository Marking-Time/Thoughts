# My Co 
One of the more interesting things I have come across in the last few years is the relationship between plants and fungi. Called mycorrhiza, these fungi were used to be thought to only have parasitic relationships with plants, but research in the past 20 years has proved it to be more complex.  
Fungi extract water and minerals from the soil and pass them to the plant through the roots of the plant.  Plants take the fats and sugars that are the result of photosynthesis and pass them to the fungi. This process forms a symbiotic relationship.  There is even research suggesting that plants can communicate through these networks of fungi. This makes the idea of the interconnectedness  of everything move from the realm of fantasy to the plausible.

###  Human Networks  
On the human side of things I have wondered how humans form networks. Why is it that people tend to "grow" on us over time? Why do people from the same town have a similar feeling about a local sports team, like when "our" team is playing the "other" team from another town. It could be explained by the economic advantage gained by "our" team winning, but that doesn't explain the emotion we attach to the game and its outcome.  

Science is also learning more about microbiomes in humans.  These bacteria are in us and surround us. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of the role that microbiomes play in our existence.  

This made me wonder if these microbiomes can foster communication networks that form between people living near each other and help to explain how people are localized.  It has been said that each of us host bacteria that is unique to us, no one else shares it. If some of our bacteria combine with those from people around us, as well as the plants and that we live near, then that could produce a shared bacteriological-fungal biome(BF-B) that both localizes and connects us.

The BF-B would be one of the mechanisms that enable humans to be a generalized species. Understanding BF-Bs could help to explain many things, like home sickness, by moving them out of the purely psychological realm. The  addition of the physical component would enhance our understanding of the the world and how we as humans interact with it. It's an interesting idea.  

Here are some possible vectors combined with potential effects:
 - The human lung is a good host for bacteria.  It is moist and warm providing bacteria living here a hospitable environment. The lungs have the ability to both take in bacteria from the surrounding environment as well as introduce the individual's BF-B to it.  This makes it a prime vector for both adapting to the environment and altering it. 
 - Food is another interesting vector.  It is widely understood that naturally produced food that is minimally processed is good for humans.  Could it be that the bacteria and fungus from this food is part of what makes it good? The food is consumed by people and excreted to be reintroduced to the environment forming a loop that connects us to the to the environment. It could be one of the reasons we long for the food we were raised on.  The BF-B in the food that we were raised on produced a biological system that is unique to us.  We miss it when we do not have it.
- Sex is another possible vector for the transmission of the BF-B.  In addition to reproduction, it could be seen as a means for connection by the mingling of the BF-Bs. The network that would form in this connection could help explain couples that have been married for a long time have a unique understanding of each other. It has been said that old married couples can complete each others sentences. Could a shared microbiome be part of the explanation for this phenomenon?
-  Considering the above scenario, water is another obvious source for connection.  It acts as both a host environment and a method for transmission. 
    
### Sexual Reproduction
Sexual reproduction follows the formula A+B+C = NewHuman - where:   
-  A is the DNA of one parent   
-  B is the DNA of the second parent   
-  C is some random information introduced in the meiosis process   

This randomness is important to humans. It provides the mechanism through which we evolve and that is our source of adaptability and resilience. The randomness introduced in sexual reproduction is our "secret sauce".  

Could it be that the random information introduced in reproduction is sourced through the microbiome? I'm not a biologist and don't know the answer to that question.  However, if the above is  true, then the C part was not truly random.  It was simply not understood and beyond our ability to calculate. 

The above is speculation but it helps to answer questions like:  
- Why our children seem to be better adapted than their parents - at least from the perspective of the parents  
- Is this why we kiss our babies? 

### Disconnection
As a culture, we seem to be more distracted than ever before. Is our disconnection a result from our increasing isolation from nature and the variation it introduces throughout our lives?  

It makes no sense to hide this information. Would it really hurt us to understand that deodorant is damaging us in the long term? The economy is not fragile. It can  withstand the failure of a few products. It is very likely that these products just need to be reformulated and different marketing applied.

I can't prove any of the above and it seems like it would be difficult to test scientifically, so I'll just leave it here for now.
