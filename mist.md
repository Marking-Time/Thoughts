1:42 AM   
Still angry and writing.   
I saw the stupid cunt cop from the food bank tonight.  She was whoring for her gun supplier Dr. Phill/Phillip Teresi/Christine/Phil Collins/Jerry Dyer/ the rodeo clown/Arbys ... "she beats the meat".  Stupid that she can't keep her mouth shut, and that is not good for her line of work.  One question. Why are you protecting the child molesters that won't leave when told?  The child is only 17 and does not consent. I really don't care what the potatoes have to say about that.

# Mist Me   
How do these people get away with it. Let me tell you.  It's a combination of things.   

### Shift Change   
The first is a product of what I have already talked about, and the second is a part of cop nomenclature. Together they are called the shift/change. They are two different things that go together.  

The trans-human technology has a great many benefits for law enforcement, it is also a trap for cops that step out of line.  A person can be almost anything. They can change race and gender and still be the same person. Eyes, hair and weight are not hard to change. I think they can change height too, but that is much harder. They can also have multiple genetic copies of themselves. They can seem to be in more than one place at once. This is the part they call the change.   

Most cops have at least one body they can change into.This allows them and their families to lead normal lives right around us without us knowing that they are cops. They change before and after work.  They literally go home as someone else. Often, the families don't know, but marrying outside the clan is discouraged.  It avoids the awkward questions about why mom/dad is so stressed out.  All they do is drive a garbage truck and how hard can that be?

The other piece is the shift rotation schedule. A cop might work for a period of time as one "character" and then have another cop with the identical appearance and DNA take over the character. It is on a rotation schedule. You can probably see the issue cops have with this. 

### The Problem for Cops
It is incredibly easy for one cop to set up another cop. A cop can get away with murder, theft, or do anything they want. They just say they were never there and the DNA evidence never matches theirs. DNA evidence is a joke and has been for some time. Simply think about blood transfusions. How does the DNA change from one person to anothers?   


Of course they don't tell you this when you sign up.  They just set you up and then coerce you into it. There is  way out and it's called cancer. Can't serve. I have a different condition called wonser. Won't serve. I never went into the program. I never signed the Non Disclosure Agreement. They know when I go into court I tell the truth. After all, they can read my mind. They would have to shoot me in the back from range, so I wouldn't be able to tell who got me. 

The average citizen doesn't have any chance at all at beating the system.
