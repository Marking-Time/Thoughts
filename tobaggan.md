# Sierra Toboggan   
I live in the Reno/Sparks area of Nevada, out by the airport. I enjoy watching the big planes take off and land.  It has quite a bit of traffic, but that makes sense considering that it's the primary airport for Carson City, the State Capitol. It also the closest commercial airport to some of the best skiing in the world as well as Lake Tahoe.    

Reno/Sparks is in the Truckee River valley and is constrained by the Sierra Nevada on the west and the ranges of the Great Basin on the east. It has no room to grow and the noise, traffic as well as the air pollution associated with the airport all pose challenges.   

All of this got me thinking about solutions and of course my mind wandered to the technical. What I thought of was a two part solution.
 
 ### Airport   
 To solve the airport problem, it could be moved to a new airport build adjacent to the Fallon Airbase. This could be a a good way to solve the problems that have come with the increased usage of the Reno airport.  It also frees up space in the Truckee River Valley that could be used for housing or environmental restoration.  The major problem with this idea is the distance from Reno and Carson City.  It is approximately 50 miles from both cities.
 ### Sierra Toboggan
 To solve the problems created by the distance from the new airport from new airport to the cities a hyperloop could be built.  With a top speed of 400 mph it could would be able to reach either city in less than 15-20 minutes depending on the route chosen.   The hyperloop has the advantage of being fast, quiet and more environmentally friendly than air travel. Also, by having the capsules sealed inside a tube, the system would be able to operate in any weather condition.  
 The entire system could be large extending from Fallon to Reno/Carson before turning west and over the Sierra to Sacramento and eventually the San Francisco bay area. It could be built along existing rail, or freeway right of ways.   Because of its scope it would need to be built in phases. Phase I would serve the Reno/Carson area. Phase II would link Reno/Carson to Sacramento with a stop at the Sierra crest to service ski and recreational uses.  A primary feature of this phase is the ability to traverse the Sierra without regard to weather.  Hyperloop technology would need to be augmented with maglev technology to provide the necessary power to get up the hills on both sides of the Sierra.  Even with the inevitable slowdowns to cross the Sierra, a trip from the bay area to Reno/Carson would likely be possible in less than 2 hours making a ski trip to the Sierra possible in a day. Phase III would extend the hyperloop from Sacramento to the bay area.

___Routes___   
 There are two rather obvious choices for phase I routes.  The first is from Fallon to Carson City along the US route 50 corridor.  It would then turn north to Reno. a bypass for Carson could enable traffic to continue to Reno without stopping at Carson City if that is the travelers destination.   
The second option uses the I80 corridor to go to Reno first before turning south to Carson City.
### The Plan  
I know the plan is audacious, but given the benefits it might be worth it.  It would definitely be world class project and might even be a part of bringing the Olympics back to the area.
