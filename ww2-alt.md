# World War Two - An Alternate Battle Plan - Europe
__Or how the movie would have been made by Hollywood__   
[WW2 - Contents](https://github.com/Marking-Time/Thoughts/blob/main/ww2-contents.md)  
 
### Prologue   
The Germans made several strategic mistakes during WW2 that wouldn't have happened if Hollywood would have produced the movie.  
- The recognition that the biggest constraint on the Germans chances for success was access to oil. One of the major reasons Rommel lost in Africa was that his tanks ran low on fuel.  This reduced his ability to maneuver against Montgomery and the British. At that stage in the war the Germans had the oil, but didn't have the ability due to the British control of the Mediterranean Sea.  Also, one of the major reasons the Germans lost the Battle of the Bulge, late in the war, was that their panzer divisions had to source some of their fuel from captured allied depots.  If they had the oil, that wouldn't have forced them to pause in their drive to the North Sea. 
- The Germans misunderstood how military technology had changed since WW1.  World War One was primarily a ground battle fought in Europe and the Germans figured that WW2 would be the same. They figured, that better tanks and modern aircraft were all they needed to develop.  They missed what should have been obvious. First all those tanks needed to be supported and the Germans were still using horses for resupply. This slowed them down and as their supply lines got longer during the Russian campaign made resupply even more difficult.  At least they brought their food with them.  
- The German order of battle was just stupid.  The Germans are obviously a smart people, so why did they choose to make their first moves in the east? The Germans fought with their ego rather than their brains. Poland was weak country before the war and they could have taken it at any point in the war.
- They missed the obvious need for oil and where they would need to go to get it.  If they had recognized this, they would have prioritized naval forces, particularly aircraft carriers.  Aircraft carriers loaded with excellent Luftwaffe aircraft would have given them better options.  
### Pre-War Years
The Germans could have built and effective modern navy that had the ability to create a strong naval blockade of England.  This would have required aircraft carriers and the supply vessels to support them. With these assets they could have virtually rendered the American Lend Lease policy ineffective and allowed the Germans to control the Western European coastal waters and perhaps more importantly the ability to control the Mediterranean Sea.   Five large and five smaller assault aircraft carriers would have been a good opening position

They also should have prioritized production of transport trucks. This would have made their blitzkrieg tactics even more effective and might have the allowed them to finish off the Russians before they could draw on their vast resources.  
### Order of Battle
 __1939__ 
 - The Germans invade France.  It is understood that Germany wanted to go east and that if they did the Russians would have responded.  To postpone this inevitable conflict they should have invaded France.  This would have given the Russians less motive to make their advances into eastern Europe and allowed the Germans to control the mainland of the European coast.  
- The Germans create and effective naval blockade of England. The naval forces they should have developed during the interwar years could have been used to isolate England from the US.  It would given the Americans a great deal of impetus to enter the war, but that would have been offset by the first mover advantage. With aircraft carriers, the Germans could have controlled the Atlantic and given them the ability to effectively mount offensive operations in North Africa and the Middle East.
- They continue to build naval forces.
__1940-1941__
- Most of this time is spent creating a marine capability that has the ultimate goal of invading the Middle East with emphasis on the oil producing countries.  
- This strategy would have relied heavily on "selling" the non aggression pact that Germany had signed with the Russians while starving the British with the blockade and reducing their the ability to fight back. 
- The Americans enter the war, but because they have no bases available in Europe, their  operations are mostly naval.
- By the end of 1941 the Germans have gained control of the Mediterranean Sea and are using shipyards in Italy as well ports in Southern France to enforce their control and rebuild naval forces lost in the Atlantic naval war.
__1942-1943__
- The Germans invade Israel and move toward the oilfields in Iraq and along the Persian Gulf coast.
- The Americans are unable to break the naval blockade of England and have to rely on a contested invasion of the western coast of North Africa. This becomes the major land battle over the next few years.
- The German invasion of Israel is successful and followed up by strategic alliances with Bath party forces in Iraq. These alliances allow the Germans to begin to create naval forces that can provide protection for their oilfields in the Middle East as well as provide cover for the Japanese in the East.
- The American invasion of North Africa is successful, but they struggle with long supply lines through the contested Atlantic as well as North Africa.   
__1945+__
- The Germans finally invade Russia and over the next two years gain and retain control of the country. This is aided by trucks that enable effective resupply and adequate oil from the Middle East. 
- The war still continues in North Africa, but considering  that the Mediterranean Sea is now a German lake. The going is difficult for the Americans.
- England is still free, but rendered ineffective by the continued naval blockade.
### End of Movie
What happens after that is impossible to predict. This is the script that Hollywood could use to create and alternative history of WW2.
