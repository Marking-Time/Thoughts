If I Recall Correctly  

If I recall correctly, Inintiative, Referendum and Recall are the law in many states.  
- Initiative
    + Creates a ballot measure to be voted on by the voting public.  If the initiative passes the initiative becomes law. 
    + Initiatives are started by petition.  If the petition gets enough signatures of registered voters it becomes a ballot measure and is placed on the ballot of the next election.
    + Different states have different requirements for the number of signatures required to get an Initiative placed on the ballot as well as the number of votes the ballot measure must get to become law.
- Referendum
    + Refendums are a simple yes or no vote on a particular issue.  
    + They don't necessarily have the weight of law, but have the effect of a poll which elected oficials can reference when making decisions. 
    + Creating a Referendum is similar to creating an Initiative and varies by state. 
    + They can serve as a notice to the elected oficial of the will of the voting public.
- Recall
    + Removes an elected oficial from office.  
    + It is not like an election in which one candidate is elected to office either filling a vacant seat or replacing an existing oficial.  
    + If a Recall is sucessful the target of the recall is removed from office and the seat is left vacant. 
    + Recalls are often voted on in "special elections", so an elected oficial can be removed at any time.  
    + The process of filling the vacant seat varies by state.  
    + The process of creating a Recall is similar to creating an Initiative or Referendum and varies by state.
      
## Thoughts  
The Initiative/Referendum/Recall process is a very powerful expressoin of the voting public.  It helps to keep the elected oficial accountable to the electorate and acts as a check on special interests.

This process is not available on the federal level, but the individual representatives and senators can be recalled since the election of these oficials are managed by state law. I think it would be interesting to have Initiave and referendum on the federal level.  It would require an amendment to the constitution for it to become federal law. Recall could also become part of the fedearl election laws, so that it would be standardized accross the states, but that also would require an amendment.  

I am very tired of having elected oficials lie to us during the election and then act completely differently once they are elected. Recalling them is an efective method of both removing an office holder from office and sending a message other oficials that bad behavior will not be tolerated.  

## An Asside
The __Equal Rights Amendment__ has been passed by congress and ratified by 38 states (over 75%), however it has not been added to federal law because congress set a limit on the time the states could take to retify the amendment.  That time limit has passed. 

Only one thing. Congress does not have to power to set time limits on the ratificatoin of amendments to the constitution. If they did have that power, it would make the constitution powerless and by consequence render the federal government invalid.
