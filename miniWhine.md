# Mini Whine

I am a full stack developer. My preferred stack is html/CSS/JS/flask/python/JSON. It is fairly easy except for one problem.  I have to use two different programming languages, Python on the backend and Java Script(JS) on the front end.  

### One Language  

I like Python. It is fairly easy to use and the indentations make it easy to read.  It has an amazing amount of libraries that I can import when the standard doesn't have what I need. It also commonly used by many coders because it is the language that comes installed with every installation of the Linux operating system, the OS used by most internet servers. It is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), so I don't need to worry about the proprietary silliness of companies. Seriously, why would I use a proprietary box end wrench? For my purposes though, it has one major flaw. I can't use it to manipulate the Document Object Model(DOM), and I need to manipulate the DOM when I do front end work with with html/CSS. Of course there is the Command Line Interface(CLI), but most super-users don't use the CLI much less the average user. As a result, I build try to build a quality User Interface/ User experience (UI/UX). 

JS is fine; I really don't have a problem with it. It is the standard FOSS language that ships with every browser, so it is the language that I have to use to manipulate the DOM. I'm sure there are workarounds that would allow me to use a different language on the front end, but that would make my code less portable because every browser that wanted to run my software would need to have that that workaround installed, and that would be a problem.  

There is another potential problem.  When you have two different languages used, a developer has to pass data between one language to another.  This increases complexity and increases the probability of errors. It also increases the potential for security risks.  

### An Idea

Why not ship Python with the browser? Python could be easily extended to provide support for the DOM and it is  already a language that is used by many developers. I do like to work and thus get paid, but the additional work required to keep these two languages and their dependencies up to date is just a waste.  I'm also tired of deprecating standards/coding practices that have been used for decades. Yes, the new and shiny is nice, but it invariably takes five lines of code to do something that I used to be able to do in one line.  

I'm keeping an eye on this space.
