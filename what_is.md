[Part 4 - What was](https://github.com/Marking-Time/Thoughts/blob/main/was.md)   

### Eureka!
By now your wondering. What could have this old geek so worked up? I have written about part of this before.  I mentioned that sometimes things are talked about in the tech and science media and then disappear after a few years of sometimes breathless hype. Usually this has two causes.  First, the science didn't work out. It didn't scale well or their was a flaw somewhere that caused the results to be wrong.  Second, it did in fact work, but it worked so well that the results were hidden for other reasons.  Those reasons often involved national security and not giving away secrets that might be used against us in a war.  This time is different. This time we found it.  The Holy Grail.  The Fountain of Youth.  The cure for cancer. A life span of 120+ years. All rolled up in a nice package.  

It also creates the ability to change your appearance.   
## Transhumanism
Remember that? The technology that combined crispr, the human genome and LLMs together with the promise of the cure for all that ails us? I know, it's wonderful. We did it. We conquered death.  

This is all amazing until you consider two things.  The first are the logical consequences and the second is how we made the discovery.

### Consequences
What happens when people live to 120+ years without serious health issues.  It destroys the economy. It destroys the environment of an already overtaxed ecosystem. 

First the health care system is destroyed. The need for doctors, nurses, hospitals, health insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies is vastly reduced if not completely eliminated in some instances. It changes everything for companies in those industries. That is bad for them.

Also, What happens when we not only refuse to die, but we keep on having children? The population just keeps on growing, but without the normal death rate to keep things in balance. 

It is not necessarily obvious to most, but our whole existence is based on a predictable life span.  I guess that's just a nice way of saying that death is a necessary part of life. At least it was. It's like the old Beatles song that had the line "and no religion too". I'm not a believer, but I cherish those that do.

Of course it destroys the economy when real estate doesn't turn over at a predictable rate and the cost of housing is already too high.  It destroys the economy PERIOD.  

__That's why it's being kept from us__

### The Bad Part 
The solution being implemented is population control. The idea is to keep people in the dark until a war or a famine or a plague can be manufactured to remove the excess population. That's bad.

### The Worst Part
This is beyond words. The key to this technology is based on the blood of humans. It was derived from a distillation of living human blood. The blood of the young was most prized because it is the freshest and without damage from living and also was still able to heal itself. It is as if the old myths of drinking the blood of your vanquished opponents were true.  As if the legends of the vampires were true.  

Remember the homeless problem of a few years ago? Ever wonder where they all went? Ever wonder why you don't meet someone who claimed to be homeless at some point, but worked their way out of it?  

The homeless were used as test subjects to develop this technology. I have seen the fires they used to destroy the evidence.  I have smelled the rotting corpses being hauled away in cattle trucks.  It's real. It happened. This is the foundation of the technology that saves us.  

I was homeless for five years.  I miss my friends.

### They Broke the Agreement - Now What  

I do not know.  

I think we need the guidance of the Pope.
