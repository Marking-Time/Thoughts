# Special Note
By now you know who I am. If you poke around this site for a while you can find a picture of me, an old white man who looks just a little pissed off. 

Normally I don't talk about this stuff because I never felt it was my business and that the people who were affected should be the ones who did the talking.  Also, I was raised in a very white environment with white schools, churches etc, so in my opinion any comments made by me would be taken as self serving cultural signaling.  

The worldview I was raised with was that all the criticism of slavery was just a little overdone.  It was a worldview that stated that slavery wasn't bad per se, and that most slaves were well treated and "only a few" unenlightened owners mistreated their property. 

I also came up in the 1960s and 70s during the Civil Rights movement and that is the view I adopted. I was, and continue to be, embarrassed by my country's abuse of black people. 


But today I'm writing angry.  When you though pizza in my face I react and thus this post. 

# Birf of a Nation
This motion picture, starring "just a fucking clown" (jafc), is nothing more than a whitewash of the truth and an attempt to justify an unspeakable institution for the purpose of its re-institution in the form of wage slavery.

This flick borrows(culturally appropriates) its title from a old film created at the beginning of the movie industry.  The original is a black and white silent film depicting a KKK lynching of a black man.  The point of the original was the glorification of the KKK and slavery.  The original used to be hard to find on the internet because of its racist content. 

### Whitewash  
It seems obvious to me the motive behind this flick is to bury the original deeper and replace it with a sanitized, "modern" view of the topic.  It should come as no surprise that the people who suffered slavery are all dead and cannot speak out against it. This tactic is part of the "aw shucks" White Trash 101 curriculum. It is an abomination. 

Jafc is nothing more than a shift/change piece of shit. What real black man (or any man for that matter) would take part in the destruction of his people's history?
