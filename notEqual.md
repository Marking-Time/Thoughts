### Military Power  
One of the more interesting things about the military is their relation to civilian power.   

In a democracy such as ours the military is subject to the control of civilian political leaders. This is the way the military likes it because it takes them out of the pettiness of politics. They can focus on the job at hand without needing to worry about a constituency. How this actually works is interesting and not the way most people, including politicians, understand. Military and civilian power operate under separate power structures that allow the military to perform their duty without undue pressure from civil government. There are many reasons for this arrangement, here are two:
- Military personnel have to do things that are outside of normal civil behavior like killing people.  In fact killing people and breaking things is what they are supposed to do. If they were subject to the same civil power structure as the rest of us, they couldn't do the job that they were ordered to do.  Orders are a big deal and must be followed. The separate power structure provides legal protection to military personnel so they can perform their tasks without worrying about anything except obeying commands that are given them.
- The power structure makes them independent from local politics. For example a local official can't complain about noise, or how personnel are treated.  The military has its own structure to ensure the military isn't bullying the local people, or are unduly influenced by local politicians.  Imagine the chaos that would ensue if a local mayor could also control the military base in their town.  

The way this is accomplished is through the Uniform Code of Military Justice or UCMJ. It is a separate legal system from the system that we all live under.  It has its own police, laws, lawyers and courts that administer the system. It is fair to personnel and allows them to perform tasks that we cannot.  

When a person is made an officer in the military they take an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States. That is the source of their power and where their loyalties lie. It is their protection from politics.
     
### Civil Power  
Civilians often misunderstand the special relationship between the our law and the laws of the military.
