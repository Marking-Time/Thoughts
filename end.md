# Last Thoughts and End of Series   
A final thought about the consequences of the technology described in this series and its effects, and the end of this series.  I'm going back to writing about technology. It is what I enjoy and dealing with all of this is annoying to me. Given what I have described here it shouldn't be to hard for the average reader to "go to Connecticut".  

### Codes
Secrets are a fact of life and necessary.  They are one of the tools we use to protect each other. They also enable democracy.   

The combination of Trans-humanism shift/change and read/write technologies it is impossible to keep secrets the way we have in the past. It all kept under wraps by the secret courts which constitute an unconstitutional but not illegal enterprise.  

### Modern Secrets   
Secrets are stored and passed in DNA. It is well understood that much of the DNA in the human body doesn't seem to express itself in traits apparent in people. It seems to be unused. It is a logical place to store information.  Just encode it in DNA that isn't expressed. No can tell that you have it in you.  Also, you can store or move information without even knowing it.  This is the biggest secret of all.   

Put it all together and you have modern society. It is fairly obvious.
