# Cell Phones

On the street cross dressing is common.  For women, dressing as a man provides a measure of safety in an otherwise dangerous environment.  Since men are viewd as being more physically aggressive and more likely to defend themselves, women sometimes dress as men as a security measure.  They are less likely to be harassed or molested if they dress as a man. Men often play along because they understand that women need the security.  This occasionally leads to humorous results, like when a woman goes into a men's restroom because she forgot how she was dressed.

Men cross dress too, but often have different motives for doing it. If a man is considering committing a crime, he may dress as a woman to conceal his identity.  Women are less likely to be caught committing a crime and are punished less severely if they are caught. The process of changing from one sex to another is called "changing clothes" for both men and women.  

In both of the above situations the reasons for changing clothes is not sexual or psychological. They are practical. Changing clothes is a means to an end.

### Trans - Seeing what isn't There

I've been a geek and science nerd for a long time and consequently have read the tech and science media to keep informed on the latest developments.  It is interesting to follow an idea from inception through lab testing and prototyping to production.  This process often takes decades. It is not uncommon for an idea that looked promising in the lab to fail to make it to production for various reasons. The failures are reported so that the others in the community will not repeat a mistake that has already been made.  Negative data is still data and therefore useful.  

Occasionally an idea that was reported to be close to production disappears from the media.  This happens sometimes with military technology because the advantage of having a technology is most pronounced when it is first used.  To use a sports analogy, you don't tell the other team what play you are going to run before you run it.  That would just be stupid.  

About a decade ago it was widely reported in the tech/science media that a breakthrough was near in the field of bioengineering. It was reported, often breathlessly, that large increases in longevity were imminent. Needless to say, that was a very interesting development and had major implications for all of humanity.  What happens when people don't die and yet continue to reproduce?  The logical result would over population on a planet that is already has its resources stretched to the breaking point.   

As time passed the news of progress on this idea just disappeared.  What happened?  Why wasn't the failure reported?  I think it succeeded.

### Transhumanism

Coded messaging is common in the media these days and has led to a mistrust of the media.  Nobody can tell what is going on because the terminology is often muddled. It's as if they are speaking Low.  

Over the past few years I have noticed a change in human behavior that has perplexed me.  I have seen women act more aggressively than I would have predicted and men that act unusually passive.  Put differently, the actions of some men and women do not match their sex. Men are conditioned against overly aggressive posturing, but women are not. I have even seen high ranking "men" in the government shake their fists over and over for the camera.  Others act like drunken fools. It's become a joke and an embarrassment.

How did this happen?  How did this breakthrough not sweep the media like a firestorm? Maybe the biggest question is why weren't the failures reported?  To put it simply, the technology has been weaponized and used politically.   

### The Meaning is Clear(text)  

The weapon that has been created has many uses.  It allows for politicians to hide their actions from the public to avoid criticism.  They simply change clothes. The street has another term to describe this technology. The cell phone. It means that their cells are phony. Their DNA has been altered. 

It also allows someone to discredit an opponent and get away with it.  Want to keep somebody in line? Just dress like a minstrel and act like an idiot. No one will ever know. Let me axe another question. Can you tell them by their actions? The "people" that do this are called snowflakes.  

Using this technology puts us in geopolitical peril. After all, it's easy to roll a drunk.

### Final Thoughts

DO NOT CALL ME ON YOUR __CELL PHONE__, you fucking whore.
