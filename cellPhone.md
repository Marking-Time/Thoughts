On the street cross dressing is common.  For women, dressing as a man provides a measure of safety in an otherwise dangerous environment.  Since men are viewd as being more physicaly agressive and more likely to defend themselves, women sometimes dress as men as a security measure.  They are less likely to be harassed or molested if they dress as a man. Men often play along because they understand that women need the security.  This ocassionaly leads to humourous results, like when a woman goes into a men's restroom because she forgot how she was dressed.

Men cross dress too, but often have different motives for doing it. If a man is considering commiting a crime he may dress as a woman to conceal his identity.  Women are less likely to be caught comitting a crime and are punished less severly if they are caught. The process of changing from one sex to another is called "changing clothes" for both men and women.
